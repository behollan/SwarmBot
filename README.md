## Note to Josh
Hi Josh. If you're reading this, it means I haven't talked to you since I made this Repo live. I'm thinking we use GitHub as our main documentation and management source. It has some pretty nifty built in features like the projects board, issue tracking, and a wiki. Figured it would be pretty helpful to just be organized in the same place that our code is going to sit. 

## Better description here eventually
