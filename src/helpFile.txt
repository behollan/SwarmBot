Usage: 
	Launching:	SwarmHost [options]
	Currently, no options are supported.

	SwarmHost takes commands and turns them into host actions. For example, typing 		"help" displays this message or typing "arucoTest" runs a sample program for 		detecting aruco tags. 

Main Commands:
	help 	 	Displays a help message with commands

	d		Set the Aruco tag dictionary. Currently supported dictionaries are:
				0	4x4 50
				1	4x4 100
				2	4x4 250
				3	4x4 1000
				4 	5x5 50
				5	5x5 100
				6	5x5 250
				7	5x5 1000
				8	6x6 50
				9	6x6 100
				10	6x6 250
				11	6x6 1000
				12	7x7 50
				13	7x7 100
				14	7x7 250
				15	7x7 1000
	
	calibFile	Set the camera calibration file location

	Locusts		Control the swarm (Implementation still WIP)	

Calibration:
	homography	Starts the Homography calibration. This only needs to be done once 				for a given setup but should be repeated if something is moved. 
	
	cameraCalib	Calibrates a camera and determines saves the detector parameters 				file on the disk

Troubleshooting
	 arucoTest 	Runs a sample arucoDetector program

	detectSquares	Detects a checkerboard pattern. Displays the detected squares on the 				output image
